This is a simple Android project that displays list of mocked movies with help of Jetpack Compose.

The project contains a set of git tags that split implementation step by step. Each step was explained in the scope of this article: https://yevhenii-datsenko.medium.com/explore-swiftui-and-jetpack-compose-6c3efa6d8bb

The repository contains the Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile module. It defines common logic and mocked movie list. I described the KMM module creation process in the following article: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/integrate-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-to-existing-android-and-ios-apps-93876060bff5
